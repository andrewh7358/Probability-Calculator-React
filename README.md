# Probablilty Calculator

Probability calculator in TypeScript and React.

Calculate the chance of `r` successes in `n` events at probability `p`. Options includes at least `r`, exactly `r`, and at most `r` successes.

`p`: Probability of getting a success as a decimal `0 <= p <= 1`.

`n`: Number of events to consider `1 <= n <= 150`. There is a limit of 150 due to calculation limits.

`r`: Number of successes wanted `0 <= r <= n`.

Example: `p = 0.5`, `n = 10`, `r = 5`
